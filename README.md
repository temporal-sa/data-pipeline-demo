   - Temporal Web UI: [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233)

## Demo Scenarios

### Web UI Demo Path

The web interface provides an intuitive way to demonstrate Temporal workflows to customers and attendees.

#### Basic Demo Flow

1. **Navigate to the Web UI** at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

2. **Submit a Job**
   - Select a scenario from the dropdown menu
   - Enter a unique Job ID (or use the generated one)
   - Click "Submit Job" to start the workflow

3. **Monitor Progress**
   - The job progress page shows real-time workflow execution
   - Progress bar updates as activities complete
   - View detailed logs and status information

4. **Explore Temporal Web UI**
   - Open [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233)
   - Show workflow history, activity details, and timeline
   - Demonstrate workflow replay and debugging capabilities

#### Available Scenarios

**HappyPath** - Standard successful workflow execution
- **What happens:** Executes complete ETL pipeline (Validate → Extract → Transform → Load → Poll)
- **Key features:** Activity heartbeats, progress tracking, distributed task queues
- **Talking points:** "This shows the basic reliability of Temporal - even if workers crash, the workflow continues seamlessly"
- **Best for:** First-time demos, establishing baseline understanding

**AdvancedVisibility** - Custom search attributes and workflow metadata
- **What happens:** Same as HappyPath but updates custom "Step" search attribute at each phase
- **Key features:** Dynamic search attributes, workflow discoverability, business intelligence
- **Talking points:** "Watch how we can track exactly where each workflow is in real-time - perfect for dashboards and reporting"
- **Demo tip:** Show Temporal Web UI search functionality with `Step:validation` queries
- **Setup required:** Run `just add-search-attribute` before first use

**HumanInLoopSignal** - Manual intervention using Signals
- **What happens:** Workflow pauses after Load activity, waits for external signal to continue
- **Key features:** Asynchronous signals, external system integration, timeout handling
- **Talking points:** "This is how you handle approvals, external callbacks, or human decisions in your workflows"
- **Demo interaction:** Use `just signal-workflow <JOB_ID>` or Web UI button during 60-second wait
- **Timeout behavior:** Fails with "Load did not complete before timeout" if no signal received

**HumanInLoopUpdate** - Manual intervention using Updates
- **What happens:** Similar to Signal but uses synchronous Update mechanism
- **Key features:** Request-response pattern, immediate feedback, validation support
- **Talking points:** "Unlike signals, updates are synchronous - you get immediate confirmation and can validate the request"
- **Demo interaction:** Use Web UI update button to show immediate response
- **Timeout behavior:** Fails with "Load did not complete before timeout" if no update received

**Idempotency** - Duplicate activity execution testing
- **What happens:** Executes Load activity twice to demonstrate idempotency guarantees
- **Key features:** Activity idempotency, exactly-once semantics, duplicate detection
- **Talking points:** "Notice how the Load activity runs twice but produces the same result - Temporal guarantees exactly-once execution"
- **Demo tip:** Show activity history to highlight duplicate execution with same results

**RecoverableFailure** - Transient error handling and recovery
- **What happens:** Workflow throws an exception mid-execution, triggering retry logic
- **Key features:** Automatic retries, exponential backoff, workflow resilience
- **Talking points:** "This simulates infrastructure failures - watch how Temporal automatically retries and recovers"
- **Demo tip:** Show failed attempts in workflow history, then resume to demonstrate recovery

**NonRecoverableFailure** - Permanent business logic failure
- **What happens:** Validation activity fails (input.validation set to "blue"), workflow terminates
- **Key features:** Business rule enforcement, graceful failure handling, error propagation
- **Talking points:** "Some failures shouldn't be retried - this shows how to handle permanent business logic failures"
- **Demo tip:** Emphasize the difference between retryable infrastructure failures and non-retryable business failures

**APIFailure** - External service failure simulation with long-running retries
- **What happens:** Poll activity fails 9 times before succeeding on attempt 10
- **Key features:** Long-running retries, external service resilience, activity retry policies
- **Talking points:** "This simulates external API downtime - Temporal keeps retrying until the service recovers"
- **Demo tip:** Show the retry attempts building up in the activity history over time



### CLI Demo Path

For technical audiences or detailed demonstrations, use the CLI interface.

#### Basic CLI Operations

1. **Start a workflow**
   ```bash
   # Using just (recommended)
   just start-workflow HappyPath demo-001
   
   # Using Temporal CLI directly
   temporal workflow start \
     --workflow-id "job-demo-001" \
     --type "DataPipelineHappyPath" \
     --task-queue "worker_specific_task_queue-distribution-queue" \
     --input '{"input_filename": "info.json", "foldername": "./demodata", "poll_or_wait": "poll", "validation": "orange", "scenario": "HappyPath", "key": "demo-001"}'
   ```

2. **Query workflow progress**
   ```bash
   just query-workflow demo-001
   
   # Or directly
   temporal workflow query --workflow-id "job-demo-001" --type "progress"
   ```

3. **Check workflow status**
   ```bash
   just workflow-status demo-001
   
   # Or directly
   temporal workflow describe --workflow-id "job-demo-001"
   ```

4. **Send signals (for HumanInLoopSignal scenario)**
   ```bash
   just signal-workflow demo-001
   
   # Or directly
   temporal workflow signal \
     --workflow-id "job-demo-001" \
     --name "load_complete_signal" \
     --input '"completed"'
   ```

#### Advanced CLI Demonstrations

**List all workflows**
```bash
temporal workflow list
```

**Show workflow history**
```bash
temporal workflow show --workflow-id "job-demo-001"
```

**Search workflows by scenario**
```bash
temporal workflow list --query 'WorkflowType = "DataPipelineAdvancedVisibility"'
```

**Cancel a running workflow**
```bash
temporal workflow cancel --workflow-id "job-demo-001"
```

**Terminate a workflow**
```bash
temporal workflow terminate --workflow-id "job-demo-001" --reason "Demo complete"
```

## Environment Configuration

### Local Development (Default)

No configuration needed. The demo uses `localhost:7233` by default.

### Temporal Cloud Configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port conflicts**: If port 7233 is in use, stop other Temporal servers with `just temporal-stop`

**Worker not starting**: Ensure Temporal server is running first

**Module import errors**: Run `uv sync` to install missing dependencies

**TLS certificate errors**: Verify certificate paths in `.env` are correct and files are readable
